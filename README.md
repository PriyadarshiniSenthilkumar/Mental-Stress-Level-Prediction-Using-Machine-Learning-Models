# Mental-Stress-Level-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Models

The proposed project focuses on developing machine learning algorithms that can analyze various aspects of individuals' behavior to detect their stress levels. The algorithms utilize a dataset collected from 
multiple individuals to identify when someone may be experiencing stress and provide potential solutions. The system for stress prediction is designed using the Random Forest and decision tree algorithms, with 
accuracy, precision, recall, and f1score serving as evaluation parameters. The dataset comprises 18 different attributes, and various machine learning models will be deployed to analyze the model's performance, 
primarily measured by accuracy. Among all the models, the random forest model has achieved the highest accuracy of 62.7% in predicting mental stress levels.
